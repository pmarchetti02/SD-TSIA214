Unfortunately it stays absurd the WHOLE time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting. Even those from the era should be turned off. The cryptic dialogue would make Shakespeare seem easy to a third grader. On a technical level it's better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great Vilmos Zsigmond.

    "### Improving representations\n",
    "\n",
    "Mainly, the arguments of the class ```vectorizer``` will allow us to easily change the way our textual data is represented. Let us try to work on our *Bag-of-words* representations:\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### Do not take into account words that are too frequent:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the argument ```max_df=1.0``` to change the amount of words taken into account. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Try different granularities:\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than just counting words, we can count sequences of words - limited in size, of course. \n",
    "We call a sequence of $n$ words a $n$-gram: let's try using 2 and 3-grams (bi- and trigrams).\n",
    "We can also try to use character sequences instead of word sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be interested in the options ```analyze='word'``` and ```ngram_range=(1, 2)``` which we'll change to alter the granularity: **obtain classification results with them**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again: using these ways of getting more features from our text will probably have more impact if we do not have much training data to begin with ! To accelerate experiments, use the ```Pipeline``` tool from scikit-learn. \n",
